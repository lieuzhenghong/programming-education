Overview: First week of building the hardware device

AAR: I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that everything went quite well. 
Zhengyang's idea to buy the testing buttons was a good one, as we were able to
test the Raspi.

The kids didn't do anything today but they did learn about a couple of things:

1. General overview of how the system works (Raspi connects to screen, buttons
connect to Raspi, etc.) 
2. Pins of the Raspi (cursory understanding of the
different features; have yet to explain what is 5V, 3.3V, GND, GPIO etc.)
3. What is a breadboard and how to work a breadboard
4. How a button can send input into the Raspi (Need to explain python code that
detects the thing that is pressed)

We did the following things:
1. Successfully set up the Raspi (SSH not working but we can use VNC)
2. Cut holes in mounting board for buttons/knobs (Bailin did this)

Things to do next session:
1. Explain the GPIO pins: what is ground, GPIO, 5V, why connect to ground... 
2. Mount and connect the proper buttons 
3. 

Need to research on:
1. How to connect the 60mm buttons?
2. ADC?
3. Best way to mount the 7" touchscreen?

Things to bring/buy next session:
- Screwdriver
- MTM jumper wires
- 3 45mm buttons
- ADC (when it arrives)
